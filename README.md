- Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. It is horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, wicked fast, and runs in production in thousands of companies.

- Zookeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds make it a perfect fit for Kafka.

- CMAK (Kafka-manager, YAHOO) is a tool for managing Apache Kafka clusters. It provides a simple web interface for managing Kafka clusters and monitoring their status.
